# WOM Role Sync Discord Bot

The WOM Role Sync Discord Bot is a Python-based application that automatically synchronizes roles between a [Wise Old Man (WOM)](https://wiseoldman.net/) group and a Discord server. This allows Old School RuneScape clans to manage their Discord roles based on their members' in-game ranks in the WOM clan.

## Features

*   **Automatic Role Synchronization:** Syncs roles every hour, fetching the latest data from the WOM API.
*   **Slash Command Configuration:** Simple server setup with intuitive commands.
*   **Nickname Enforcement:** Option to enforce member nicknames to match their RuneScape Name (RSN).
*   **DM Notifications:** Users can opt-in to receive direct messages when their roles are changed.
*   **Inactivity Reminders:** Admins can be prompted to re-sync their WOM group if it becomes inactive.
*   **Web-based Landing Page:** A simple Flask-based website serves as a landing page for the bot, displaying statistics and setup instructions.

## Getting Started
